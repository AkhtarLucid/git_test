# Introduction to the Project
This public repository describes a simple problem statement and How Machine Learning can be leveraged to solve the business problem.

The problem statement is to Identify/predict the default agencies in the Organization. We are provide with different tables data in the form of CSV files.
Each of the steps starting from the Data Migration until Deployment using Flask is been coded in different files respectively.

## Details of different files

1. preprocessing.py --> Training data is pre-processed which includes different statistical techniques.
2. cleaning-transformation.py -- Whole data provided is being cleaned and transformed such as Handling missing data, Outliers,Skewness,Spikes and Dips etc.
3. test.py ---> Test data is being segregated from the whole data to make sure Data leakage does not happens.
4. model.py --> Different ML models with Hyper-parameter tuning is applied extensively here.
5. requirements.txt --> Whole bunch of libraries and dependies are jotted down here.
